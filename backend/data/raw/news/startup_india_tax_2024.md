The Ministry of Finance has announced an extension of the tax holiday for recognized 
startups under the Startup India initiative for another year until March 2025. This 
is expected to significantly improve the cash flow for early-stage (Seed and Series A) 
startups, particularly those in the deep-tech and AI sectors who have high upfront 
R&D costs.
