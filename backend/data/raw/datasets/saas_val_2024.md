The median revenue multiple for early-stage SaaS companies (Seed - Series A) has stabilized
at 8.2x ARR globally in 2024. However, companies in high-growth markets like India and 
Southeast Asia are commanding a 15-20% premium (reaching 9.5x - 10x) if they demonstrate 
local market dominance and positive unit economics.
