## Troubleshooting 🔧

### "Failed to scan receipt" error
- Ensure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correctly set in `.env.local`
- Check that the API key is valid and has not expired
- Make sure the image is a clear receipt photo

### "File size should be less than 5MB" error
- Compress your image before uploading
- Use a different image format (JPEG usually has smaller file sizes)

### Port 3000 is already in use
```bash
# Use a different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Build errors
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```
